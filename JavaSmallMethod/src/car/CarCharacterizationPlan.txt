A car manufacturer company had 2 lines of car types: 4x4 and Sedan.
These car types have several implementations such as Santa-Fe and i30.
This is how the model classes and interfaces looked like:

public interface Car{
    void park();
    void stop();
    void drive();
}
public interface 4x4 extends Car{
    void 4WeelDrive();
}
public class Santa-Fe implements 4x4{
  public void 4WeelDrive(){...}
}
public interface Sedan extends Car{
    void openTrunk();
}
public class i30 implements Sedan{
  void openTrunk(){..}
}
At some point the company decided to create a new type of car: Tuscon.
This type of car has to have the features of both Sedan(i30) and 4x4(Santa-Fe).
You need create and code the new Tuscon class using the classes and interfaces above.
Note that in Java you cannot use multiple inheritance.
